# Continuous Releases <span><img src="https://emoji.slack-edge.com/TFHDVN56F/stackblitz/fd010078dcccebca.png" width="35" /></span>

With Stackblitz CR, each of your commits and pull-requests would trigger an instant build and a release. This enables users to access features and bug-fixes without the need to wait for release cycles using npm or pull-request merges. 

- 🚀 Instant Builds
- 📦️ No Configuration
- 🛠️ Github Workflows Friendly


The Github Application is available [here](https://github.com/apps/stackblitz-cr).

CR is aiming to reduce the number of these comments :) 

> This was fixed in #18. Can we release that fix?

> Will ask the maintainer to release ;)
